A special thanks for [Mentorness](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mentorness/) for providing this opportunity and experiences that come with it !

The project has been implemented by ``Yaser Alshuaybat`` [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaser-alshuaybat-611069268/) [Github](https://github.com/YSKAA423)

The task is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify mobile phones into predefined price
ranges based on various attributes such as battery power, camera features, memory, connectivity options,
and more. The dataset provided contains information about several mobile phones, including their
specifications and corresponding price ranges.
